[TEXT_SET:ANIMAL_SLAYER]

I have taken down [CONTEXT:NUMBER] [CONTEXT:RACE:NUMBERED_NAME] while stalking [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME].
I done killed [CONTEXT:NUMBER] [CONTEXT:RACE:NUMBERED_NAME] over in [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME].
I don't mean to brag, but when I was in [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME] I got [CONTEXT:NUMBER] [CONTEXT:RACE:NUMBERED_NAME], and that's no mean feat.
Hey, I've taken down [CONTEXT:NUMBER] [CONTEXT:RACE:NUMBERED_NAME] at [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME], and that's no mean feat.
A lot of people probably think hunting [CONTEXT:RACE:NUMBERED_NAME] is a pretty serious sport, but I've taken down [CONTEXT:NUMBER] of them over in [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME].
