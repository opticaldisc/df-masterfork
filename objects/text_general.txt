[TEXT_SET:GENERAL]

whose cries for mercy went unheeded by my wrath
whose insignificant name I struggle to recall
a spineless slug who was crushed under my might
whom I buried alive under a mountain of hatred
who lies dead, now only an embarrassing memory
who sought my praise, only to be rejected in death
once revered by those who didn't know any better

who barely had the strength to lift [PRO_POS] own arms
whose entrails covered the floor
whose skull now lies in pieces
whose life was snuffed out like an old candle
whose bones you now stand on
who was a fool to have stood before me
who cowered before me in terror
who begged for mercy as I laughed in [PRO_POS] face
who cried like a babe at my approach
who tried in vain to outrun me
who wore my hand around [PRO_POS] throat
who made the mistake of angering me

who wore [PRO_POS] entrails around [PRO_POS] neck
who tried to fight, but was scattered before my strikes like grain to a scythe
who tried to change things that were not meant to be changed
who lost all in [PRO_POS] attempt at battle
who couldn't fight on a real battlefield
whose skill in fighting couldn't match [PRO_POS] tormentor's
whose passion was only a candle compared to my raging fire
who has been forever silenced
who was lost
for whom the bell now tolls
who walks with the gods now
whose story is ended
who will never know another day
who tried to fight [PRO_POS] fate
who was made to swallow [PRO_POS] own weapon
whose face met my foot at great speeds
whose name shall be buried by the sands of time, forgotten by all
who has gone to where all souls one day go
who I barely remember
whose ghost I laugh at
upon whose grave I trample
who knows the taste of death
Whose pickaxe was no match for my weapon
Who should have not picked on someone larger than [PRO_POS]
Whose magma could not save [PRO_POS]
Who, although brave, was a complete idiot
Who should have stayed home, hugging trees
Who banged wood over my armor, to no effect
Who was shown why elves don't go to war with [SPEAKER:RACE]s

whose blood I drank like wine
whose body I seperated into many parts, and whose soul I split into many more
who could have trained for a thousand years and still would have fallen short of me
a worm unfit even to grovel before me
who I split in two with a single blow
who even my grandmother could have bested[spoiler](more potential!)

who recently became a martyr for mediocrity
whose face met my foot at high velocity
who has gone to where all men and beasts one day go
whose grave I piss on
enjoys the taste of worm
whose bones have made a fine back scratcher
