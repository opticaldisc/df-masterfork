[TEXT_SET:WANDERING_PROFESSION]

I wander [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME].
I roam the lands. My travels have taken me all around [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME].
I live the life of a nomad in [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME].
I am a vagabond. I have wandered [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME].
I wander [CONTEXT:PLACE:TRANS_NAME], do you not also believe it beautiful?
I just wander about really, I'm not really good at staying put.
I just wander about really, I guess that makes me a wanderer.
Oh, I'm not from around here, I wander from place to place. Nowhere ever really feels like home.
