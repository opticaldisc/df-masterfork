[TEXT_SET:NO_FAMILY]

I have no family to speak of
I have no family
I have no children, nor lover or mother or father
I am alone
Family is for the weak
I have no material ties to this world
Where I am from, it is considered rude for a stranger to ask such personal questions
Family is meaningless
I refuse to answer that question
Why do you ask me such things?
Family... would be nice
I could've had a family
That question is painful, don't ask it again
What would it matter to you?
I live alone
I have no family for now, but maybe in the future
I have no family now, but my heart is set on another. Ask me in the future when I succeed
...
Tell me about YOUR family
Stop asking me these things
I'm afraid I don't remember
Wh-why do you ask me if I have family? O-o-of course I have a family! Ha! Ha! Ha! What kind of silly fool wouldn't have a family? It must be quite silly to not have a family, wouldn't it? Hahahahaha!!!
That question is pointless
Leave me alone already
I don't have a family and I don't care for one either
I don't have a family. Let's just leave it at that
I have always only depended on myself
I only need strength. Love is but an illusion
Why don't you join me for some drinks and we'll discuss this further at my home
My friends are to me what family is to you
Why do you ask? Are you looking for love?
That's a complicated question with a complicated answer. Ask me something else
Stop asking all these senseless questions!
Don't you have something more important to do?
Family only gets in the way, wouldn't you agree?
My family is in a far away land
I came here to forget my past, please don't ask again
By the Gods, you are annoying
Family, huh? Family... family... family...
I, uh, don't have one
family? I don't have a "family"
my history is shrouded by uncertainty, I don't know if I have any family
