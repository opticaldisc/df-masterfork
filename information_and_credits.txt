---------------------------------------- MASTERFORK GENERATIVE AI POLICY ----------------------------------------

  I shall NEVER allow MASTERFORK to be tarnished by generative AI content of the following nature(*):

 - sprites (both UI and/or creature tiles)
 - sound of any kind
 - anything graphical what-so-ever
 - RAWS that are written in its ENTIRETY, or in large by generative AI

 * conditionally allowed:
   1. {TEXT_SET}
   (generative content in these raws I belive are fine as they do not go, in my opinion, against the spirit of the game
    -and are UNDER THE CONDITION that each entry is manually reviewed for quality and consistency.)
